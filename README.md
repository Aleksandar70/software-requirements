Data dictionary project

Data dictionary - a set of information describing the contents, format, and structure of a database and the relationship between its elements, used to control access to and manipulation of the database.

This is an example of the language for creating data dictionary. All concepts are covered which contains one complete data dictionary. When creating dictionary elements, certain constraints and rules are given, by which they respect certain requirements from the real system. Also, in case some of these rules are violated, it is offered automatic correction (quick fix) of the same. We have defined 14 rules. The following rules are defined in the system:

1. rule_IAbstractStructure_min_one_element
2. rule_aggregation_duplicate
3. rule_aggregation_in_Set
4. rule_exclusive_duplicate
5. rule_field_length
6. rule_field_starts_with
7. rule_field_unique_name
8. rule_generic_name_field
9. rule_generic_name_structure
10. rule_nonExclusive_duplicate
11. rule_set_duplicate
12. rule_structure_length
13. rule_structure_starts_with
14. rule_structure_unique_name

Two constraints are defined:

1) Aggregation_Constraints
2) Set_Constraint

This language for creating data dictionaries over defined rules and constraints allows the dictionary a credible representation of the real system. Also, automatic correction (quick fix) is large
the importance of facilitating the user. Using this language ensures consistency data and easy maintenance of the dictionary itself.
